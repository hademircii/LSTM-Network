This is an LSTM network, a type of a recurrent neural network that is considered as the state-of-art model for classifying sequential data. It is programmed for a class project (CMPS242), aims to classify tweets from two different users (Clinton/Trump in this case). Includes preprocessing of tweets, then uses gensim library to develop a word to vector model. Built with Tensorflow.
